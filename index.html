    <h2>Moby Dick (or, the Whale)</h2>
    <p>
      The
      <a href="https://www.softcover.io" target="_blank">Softcover</a>
      publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks like some popular IT
      textbooks but it's also good for making more traditional books, such as
      the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as Moby
      Dick). We present below and affectionately irreverent book report on this
      classic of American literature.

        ><em>Moby-Dick</em></a
      >
      by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Call me Ishmael. Some years ago-never mind how precisely-having little or
      no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore. I
      thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.
      I have off driving of the spleen and regulating the circulation.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      After driving off this spleen (<em>which can't be good for you</em>),
      Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one jillion
      page. The only thing bigger than the Moby Dick
      (who-<em>spoiler-alert!</em>-is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
